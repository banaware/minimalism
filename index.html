            <h3>What is Minimalism?</h3>
            <p>
                Minimalism is defined as a design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect. Minimalism had its origins in the arts—with the artwork featuring simple lines, only a few colors, and careful placement of those lines and colors.
                <br><br>
                More recently, it has become representative of a lifestyle that aims to remove clutter from all facets of life.
                <br><br>
                Minimalism is all about owning only what adds value and meaning to your life (as well as the lives of the people you care about) and removing the rest. It’s about removing the clutter and using your time and energy for the things that remain. We only have a certain amount of energy, time, and space in our lives. In order to make the most of it, we must be intentional about how we’re living each day.

                    <ul>
                        <li>user-friendly interface;</li>
                        <li>hidden navigation;</li>
                        <li>no more than three colors at once;</li>
                        <li>lots of empty space;</li>
                        <li>experimentation with fonts;</li>
                        <li>no excess detail: color transitions, shadows, textures;</li>
                        <li>no extra buttons.</li>

                <p>
                    There are many different approaches to minimalism, but in web design it’s really just a tool to help you prioritize what’s important in your website.

                    Whitespace, or negative space (which would be the more appropriate design term), is the space between elements in a composition. There are many benefits to using whitespace, but first and foremost, it improves the user experience and concentrates attention on webpage content and your product.

                    Whitespace adds balance to a design. By being conscious about what occupies the space between your website’s main content blocks, you can make your site captivate readers, inviting them to stay longer and scroll further.
                    <br><br>
                    Having a lot of whitespace is one of the main tricks to a minimalist style.
                    <br><br>
                    Look at the beautiful implementation of whitespace on the website of Thomas Slack, an LA fashion and portrait photographer. There’s nothing to distract users from the inspiring beauty of his work.

            When using bright colors, mix them up with more soothing, toned-down complementary hues, throw in some black or white typography, and have yourself a beautiful bright product like the examples above and below.
            <br><br>
            Also, try and avoid complex animations, sharp transitions between content blocks and funky fonts.

            Remember: minimalism is the art of less. You should choose one thing and concentrate on it to the fullest. Here, color alone is more than enough.

        <p class="extra">
            Beautiful bold fonts are one of the main trends in the 2018 web design arena. You can go as creative as you want here; just make sure that the font is easy to read and really catches the attention of your users.
            <br><br>
            When it comes to minimalism, efficient use of typography can compensate for sparse usage of imagery and animations, making your website visually attractive. Fonts create hierarchy, telling your visitors what’s important and helping them navigate the pages.
            <br><br>
            It’s important to keep in mind that the way fonts are displayed on mobile screens will reflect on the overall usability of your product. According to Statista, between 2009 and 2017, more than 50% of all webpages were created with a mobile-first approach. And with the abundance of mobile devices on the market, this trend is likely to continue.
            <br><br>
            Apart from this, in 2018 Google is going to present its new Mobile First Index, which will place more importance on a website’s mobile version, placing mobile sites at the top of search results. This means that mobile-friendly is a must for websites that want to be seen by search engines.
            <br><br>
            Sans Serif fonts are the best choice when it comes to creating a minimalist website just because of how crisp and clean they tend to look. You can find more information on fonts and how they influence user perception in our article about designing a medical application.

        <h6 class="extra-half center">
            Here are some creative studios that have successfully implemented bright bold fonts in their homepage designs

        </div>

        <p>
            Font size is another important aspect of minimalist design, especially if there aren’t many other elements on the page. Using small fonts can be a great way of presenting information without taking up too much space. However, be careful, as small text can easily get lost on the page and make the design appear dirty and distracting.
        </p>

        <article id="vogue">
            <p>
                Look at the example below, a website that belongs to the FactoryDowntown artist management agency. Although it looks stylish and minimalist, the black font they use on the white background can be hard to read on some magazine covers. Another interesting detail is that sometimes letters cover models’ faces and magazine titles, which in a way communicates that the work was done by this particular agency.
                <br><br>
                We can’t just leave the website without mentioning the great solution they implemented for the “Artists” menu, but telling you why it’s worth mentioning wouldn’t be fair. Go check it out yourself!

            To create an effortless effect, divide your textual content into blocks. Blocks help users perceive text better and add lightness to the overall design.

            According to George A. Miller, one of the founders of cognitive psychology who also contributed to psycho linguistics and studies of human memory and communication, short-term memory can only hold seven pieces of information at once, plus or minus two. You can read Miller’s original article if you want, but the takeaway is the following: the more pieces of information you add to your user interface, the more difficult it will be to work with, especially the first time.

                    The main way of creating a minimalist vibe is to remove every excess, but sometimes designers can go a bit too far, removing most website navigation buttons. Although it does make sense to remove rarely used elements, make sure that you aren’t hiding links and instruments that are important to your users.
                    <br><br>
                    Our advice is to leave the Menu button untouched and encapsulate the rest of the navigation buttons inside it. The Homepage button can be hidden in the company logo.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from that, make sure that buttons are highlighted in some way when pointed at so users know that they’re actually clickable.

            “Subtract it till it breaks” is the favorite mantra of many minimalist designers. What it really means is unless the absence of some element is a serious problem, go ahead and get rid of it.

            Of course, you could just say this is a necessary design quirk, but the idea is that design shouldn’t just look cool; it should also be usable. Nothing new, we know; but keep it in mind all the same.

                Minimalist design has been among the most popular design approaches for a long time, and this trend is likely to continue. Designers enjoy going for minimalism, shifting away from content overload and some of the heavier design types.
            </p>

            <p>
                Minimalism is simple only at first glance; in order to make it light and user-friendly you need to think each element through very thoroughly. Never sacrifice usability for the sake of visuals, organize your content, and strive to create a more efficient path across the website.
