            <h3>What is Minimalism?</h3>
            <p>
                Minimalism is defined as a design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect. Minimalism had its origins in the arts—with the artwork featuring simple lines, only a few colors, and careful placement of those lines and colors.
                <br><br>
                More recently, it has become representative of a lifestyle that aims to remove clutter from all facets of life.
                <br><br>
                Minimalism is all about owning only what adds value and meaning to your life (as well as the lives of the people you care about) and removing the rest. It’s about removing the clutter and using your time and energy for the things that remain. We only have a certain amount of energy, time, and space in our lives. In order to make the most of it, we must be intentional about how we’re living each day.

                    <h5>The main principles of minimalism in web design:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>user-friendly interface;</li>
                        <li>hidden navigation;</li>
                        <li>no more than three colors at once;</li>
                        <li>lots of empty space;</li>
                        <li>experimentation with fonts;</li>
                        <li>no excess detail: color transitions, shadows, textures;</li>
                        <li>no extra buttons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    There are many different approaches to minimalism, but in web design it’s really just a tool to help you prioritize what’s important in your website.
